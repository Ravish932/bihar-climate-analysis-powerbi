# 🌍 Bihar Climate Data Analysis (1975–2024)

This project analyzes **50 years of Bihar’s climate data** (1975–2024) using **Power BI**.  
It highlights key patterns in **temperature, rainfall, CO₂ levels, and extreme weather events** across 38 districts of Bihar.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **data visualization** can uncover climate change trends and provide **actionable insights** for resilience and policy planning.

## 🌦 Seasons of Bihar  

Bihar has a **diverse climate** with four major seasons that strongly influence agriculture, water resources, and living conditions:  

- ☀ **Summer (March–June)** → Hot and dry, with temperatures reaching **40–45°C** in many districts.  
- 🌧 **Monsoon (July–September)** → Heavy rainfall season, contributing to ~80% of annual precipitation.  
- 🍂 **Post-Monsoon / Autumn (October–November)** → Transition period with moderate temperature and occasional showers.  
- ❄ **Winter (December–February)** → Cold and dry, with temperatures dropping to **5–7°C** in some northern districts.

## 📊 Seasonal Rainfall Contribution  

| Season        | Contribution to Annual Rainfall |  
|---------------|--------------------------------|  
| 🌧 Monsoon    | ~80%                           |  
| 🍂 Post-Monsoon | ~10%                           |  
| ☀ Summer      | ~7%                            |  
| ❄ Winter      | ~3%                            |  

➡ The dominance of the **monsoon season** shows why even small shifts in rainfall trends have a huge impact on Bihar’s agriculture and water resources.
